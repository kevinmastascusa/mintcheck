- Analyzes border consistency on all sides
- Critical for high-grade cards

### Corners (25% weight)
- Examines the condition of all four corners
- Detects wear, damage, and whitening
- Essential for mint condition assessment

### Edges (25% weight)
- Analyzes edge condition and wear
- Detects chipping, whitening, and damage
- Important for overall card integrity

### Surface (25% weight)
- Evaluates surface condition and print quality
- Detects scratches, print defects, and wear
- Critical for visual appeal and value

## üìä PSA Grading Scale

| Grade | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Gem Mint | 9.5-10.0 | Perfect card with no visible flaws |
| Mint | 9.0-9.4 | Nearly perfect with only minor flaws |
| Near Mint-Mint | 8.0-8.9 | Excellent condition with minor wear |
| Near Mint | 7.0-7.9 | Very good condition with some wear |
| Excellent-Mint | 6.0-6.9 | Good condition with noticeable wear |
| Excellent | 5.0-5.9 | Above average condition |
| Very Good-Excellent | 4.0-4.9 | Average condition |

## üî¨ Defect Detection & Computational Photography
